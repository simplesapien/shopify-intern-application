This repository showcases my application for Shopify's 2022 Front-end Web Development Summer Internship program.

## Behind the Scenes

### Key Technologies and Features

- **Three.js**: Employed to create a star field on the landing page. 
- **Parallax Effect**: A subtle parallax effect was integrated for the hero banner on the gallery page, providing a dynamic user experience.

## Reflections

Creating this application provided a plethora of learning opportunities. Working with Three.js allowed me to explore complex graphics rendering on the web, and finding solutions to memory constraints emphasized the importance of optimization, especially in web-based environments.

I'm proud of the result and hope it showcases my passion and skills in front-end web development. Feedback and insights are always welcome!
